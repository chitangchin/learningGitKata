Practicing Learn Git Branching through GitHub repo for practice without visuals

Challenge 1: Git Commit (Easy)

1. Add any git changes you have made (Specify specific files)

2. Make a Git commit within the Main branch (Try first without using -m)
understanding how to navigate around the default text editor

- press the i key to insert your commit description

- once you are finished, type :wq
(:w is the command to write while :q is the command to quit. This can be combined to :wq to shorten the commands)

3. Make a new change to file sandbox.txt

4. Add the specific file you changed

Later in the future we will work on understanding the different git add commands and when/why you would want to use them:

git add .
git add -A
git add -u

For now, because we are working with only few files, you can git add specific files that have been changed

Add more than one file:
git add 'file1' 'file2'

There are many different ways to git add files, especially in larger repositories, if you wanted to git add an entire folder or specify a certain file time.
